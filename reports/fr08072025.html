<p>Hey there, fellow anglers! Welcome to my Port Aransas fishing diary&mdash;where the salt meets the soul and the stories are just as good as the catch. Let&rsquo;s dive into what&rsquo;s biting right now, the best surf‑fishing times, offshore highlights, and the latest on season rules.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Best Times for Surf Fishing</h2>
<p>If you're chasing fish from the shoreline, <strong>twilight hours</strong>&mdash;early morning and evening&mdash;are your golden window, especially when they align with <strong>major or minor solunar feeding periods</strong>. Look out for these peaks when the <strong>moon is rising or setting</strong> or directly overhead.</p>
<p>According to today&rsquo;s fishing forecast:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Thursday (Aug 7):</strong> Good fishing between <strong>7:19 AM and 11:19 AM</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Friday (Aug 8):</strong> Below average, but still workable between <strong>9:09 AM and 1:09 PM</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monday (Aug 11):</strong> <strong>Great day</strong> with prime time early&mdash;<strong>4:03 AM to 8:03 AM</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan to hit the beach during those early‑morning windows for your best chances at surf success.</p>

<h2>Offshore &amp; Nearshore Species Targeting</h2>
<h3>Nearshore &amp; Surf Reports</h3>
<p>TPWD reports for August 6 show:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Redfish</strong> are doing great on the <strong>north and south jetties</strong> using live shrimp and finger mullet&mdash;and some monster reds are taking cut crab and mullet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speckled trout</strong> are hitting croaker and shrimp fished along rocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kingfish and Spanish mackerel</strong> are showing up in force using ribbonfish or trolling shiny lures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summer Offshore Highlights</h3>
<p>From <strong>June through August</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Red snapper</strong> is in-season&mdash;especially offshore&mdash;with a daily limit of 2 per person (16&Prime; min) federally and 4 per day (15&Prime; min) in state waters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>King mackerel (kingfish)</strong> are at peak numbers around shrimp boats; use shrimp as bait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mahi‑Mahi</strong> thrive near weed lines&mdash;cruise days offer great hits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marlin and sailfish</strong> bite best in warm summer months&mdash;plan charters accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Cast</h2>
<p>Whether you're casting from the surf at dawn or chasing offshore giants, Port Aransas is delivering right now. Here's the game plan:</p>
<ul>

<p>Hit the surf around dawn/evening when tides align with solunar peaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For inshore action: Redfish and trout are on fire&mdash;bring shrimp, mullet, croakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offshore buzz: Red snapper, kingfish, mahi-mahi, sailfish&mdash;all summer standouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay legal: Know current bag &amp; size limits and check federal vs. state waters for red snapper season.</p>
</li>
</ul>
